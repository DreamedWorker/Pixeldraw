# Pixel-draw
With content from DexerMatters and hyx123251

## Introduction
An application that allows you to draw pixel pictures mainly for Minecraft. 
And we will embed some of its functions into mStudio to help you develop your projects more efficiently.
The previous project was developed by using Java and android.support, so this one we use modern Android Developer Kits
to optimize the project and make it suitable when you are using an Android 9 and newer phone.

## Questions
- Why app restarted when I try to open a folder like /Android ?
  The reason is that Google has special restrictions on access to special folders for high Android versions, so we can't open this folder.
- Why my file list did not show me my files in my folder?
  Because you do not authorize access to the application file. Go to Settings-> Application Management to give the required permissions to the application.
- Will this project be maintained continuously?
  I am sorry! The reason is NO.
